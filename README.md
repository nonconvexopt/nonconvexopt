### My Life Goals
- :page_facing_up: Develop an ability to publish academic papers at AI/ML top venues consistently.
- :robot: Alternate my body with mechanic parts to extend my life as long as I want. Be a pioneer of the age of cyberpunk.
- :seedling: Gave birth to my human clone by using somatic-cell nuclear transfer and endometrium(or artificial womb). Raise and educate him as my son. Since his DNA will be same with me and it might be hard to change after birth, devote to help him to improve any his epigenetic characteristics he wants. Feel the responsibility and love stronger than paternal love.
- :sunglasses: Proactively determine my longevity and the day I will end my life by voluntary euthanasia. Hold the funeral of myself while I am still alive.
