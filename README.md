### My Life Goals(21.11.3)
- :page_facing_up: Develop an ability to publish academic papers at AI/ML top venues consistently. Have an experience of publishing paper in solo author.
- :robot: Alternate my body with mechanical parts and be a pioneer of the age of cyberpunk. Modify my physical functionality on occasion and extend my life as long as I want. Keep my heart running in the water tank at my home to remember and to keep remind that I was once a human.
- :seedling: Give birth to my human clone by using the somatic-cell nuclear transfer and the artificial womb. Raise and educate him as my son. Since his DNA will be same with me and it might be hard to change after birth, take responsibility and devote to help him to improve any epigenetic characteristic he wants. Account for his environment, education, physical activities and experiences. Feel the love stronger than paternal love and be a responsibile host. (Used 'host' though I do not possess him but I am not strictly his parent).
- :sunglasses: Proactively determine my lifespan and the day I will end my life by voluntary euthanasia. Hold the funeral of myself while I am still alive.

### Mutations
- _In general, optimization solving algorithms converge to a local minimum. To get out of this local minimum in a Genetic Algorithm, you can use mutations. Mutations are applied to some individuals of a generation. Usually, mutations will be bad and make the result worse and they will not be selected for the next generation, but sometimes, a mutation causes an individual to get close to a different (and sometimes better) local minimum. The higher the mutation rate is, the more 'space' will be searched and the higher the chance that the global minimum is found. There is a catch though; If the mutation rate is too high, the algorithm won't converge anymore._ ([From Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31215003/genetic-algorithm-selection-method-stuck-at-local-minimum-after-few-generations))
