### My Life Goals(21.10.27)
- :page_facing_up: Develop an ability to publish academic papers at AI/ML top venues consistently. Have an experience publishing solo author paper. Develop methods which is able to produce real world values.
- :robot: Alternate my body with mechanical parts and be a pioneer of the age of cyberpunk. Modify my physical functionality on occasion and extend my life as long as I want. Keep my heart running in the water tank at my home to remember and to keep remind that I was once a human. Do care about human race anytime when it is affordable. 
- :seedling: Give birth to my human clone by using the somatic-cell nuclear transfer and the artificial womb. Raise and educate him as my son. Since his DNA will be same with me and it might be hard to change after birth, take responsibility and devote to help him to improve any epigenetic characteristic he wants. Provide environment, education, physical activities and experiences. Feel the love stronger than paternal love and be a responsibile host. (Used 'host' though I do not possess him but I am not his parent).
- :sunglasses: Proactively determine my lifespan and the day I will end my life by voluntary euthanasia. Hold the funeral of myself while I am still alive.
